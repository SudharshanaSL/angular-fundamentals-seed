The context for terms in an expression is a blend of the template variables, the directive's context object (if it has one), and the component's members. If you reference a name that belongs to more than one of these namespaces, the template variable name takes precedence, followed by a name in the directive's context, and, lastly, the component's member names.

Smart/Container component communicate with services and render child components or pass data to child components
Dumb/Presentational component accept data via inputs and emit data changes via event outputs


One way dataflow:
container -> child components, child component changes, how does the container come to know of the change?
Change should be emitted with the use of events

event flow is bottom to top
data flow is top to bottom

Definitions of styles of each component are customized by angular to avoid interference with styles on same items in other components.
This is called view encapsulation
